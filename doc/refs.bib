	title = {Assessment of Internal Validity of Prognostic Models through Bootstrapping and Multiple Imputation of Missing Data},
	volume = {41},
	issn = {2251-6085},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Prognostic models have clinical appeal to aid therapeutic decision making. Two main practical challenges in development of such models are assessment of validity of models and imputation of missing data. In this study, importance of imputation of missing data and application of bootstrap technique in development, simplification, and assessment of internal validity of a prognostic model is highlighted.
{METHODS}: Overall, 310 breast cancer patients were recruited. Missing data were imputed 10 times. Then to deal with sensitivity of the model due to small changes in the data (internal validity), 100 bootstrap samples were drawn from each of 10 imputed data sets leading to 1000 samples. A Cox regression model was fitted to each of 1000 samples. Only variables retained in more than 50\% of samples were used in development of final model.
{RESULTS}: Four variables retained significant in more than 50\% (i.e. 500 samples) of bootstrap samples; tumour size (91\%), tumour grade (64\%), history of benign breast disease (77\%), and age at diagnosis (59\%). Tumour size was the strongest predictor with inclusion frequency exceeding 90\%. Number of deliveries was correlated with age at diagnosis (r=0.35, P{\textless}0.001). These two variables together retained significant in more than 90\% of samples.
{CONCLUSION}: We addressed two important methodological issues using a cohort of breast cancer patients. The algorithm combines multiple imputation of missing data and bootstrapping and has the potential to be applied in all kind of regression modelling exercises so as to address internal validity of models.},

	shorttitle = {Regression Modeling Strategies},
	abstract = {This highly anticipated second edition features new chapters and sections, 225 new references, and comprehensive R software. In keeping with the previous edition, this book is about the art and science of data analysis and predictive modelling, which entails choosing and using multiple tools. Instead of presenting isolated techniques, this text emphasises problem solving strategies that address the many issues arising when developing multi-variable models using real data and not standard textbook examples. Regression Modelling Strategies presents full-scale case studies of non-trivial data-sets instead of over-simplified illustrations of each method. These case studies use freely available R functions that make the multiple imputation, model building, validation and interpretation tasks described in the book relatively easy to do. Most of the methods in this text apply to all regression models, but special emphasis is given to multiple regression using generalised least squares for longitudinal data, the binary logistic model, models for ordinal responses, parametric survival regression models and the Cox semi parametric survival model. A new emphasis is given to the robust analysis of continuous dependent variables using ordinal regression.As in the first edition, this text is intended for Masters' or {PhD}. level graduate students who have had a general introductory probability and statistics course and who are well versed in ordinary multiple regression and intermediate algebra. The book will also serve as a reference for data analysts and statistical methodologists, as it contains an up-to-date survey and bibliography of modern statistical modelling techniques.},

Clearly illustrates the advantages of modern computing to such handle surveys, and demonstrates the benefit of this statistical technique for researchers who must analyze them. Also presents the background for Bayesian and frequentist theory. After establishing that only standard complete-data methods are needed to analyze a multiply-imputed set, the text evaluates procedures in general circumstances, outlining specific procedures for creating imputations in both the ignorable and nonignorable cases. Examples and exercises reinforce ideas, and the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas presents a unified picture of modern statistics.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: We determined differences in the prevalence of blood pressure ({BP}) phenotypes and the association of these phenotypes with left ventricular hypertrophy ({LVH}) for individuals who fulfilled and did not fulfill various criteria used for defining a complete ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) recording.
{METHODS}: We analyzed data for 1141 participants from the Jackson Heart Study. Criteria evaluated included having greater than or equal to 80\% of planned readings with more than or equal to one reading per hour (Spanish {ABPM} Registry criteria), more than or equal to 70\% of planned readings with a minimum of 20 daytime and seven nighttime readings (2013 European Society of Hypertension criteria), greater than or equal to 14 daytime and greater than or equal to seven nighttime readings (2003 European Society of Hypertension criteria), more than or equal to 10 daytime and more than or equal to 5 nighttime readings (International Database of Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcome criteria), and greater than or equal to 14 daytime readings ({UK} National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence criteria).
{RESULTS}: Between 45.0\% (Spanish {ABPM} Registry) and 91.8\% ({UK} National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence) of the participants fulfilled the different criteria for a complete {ABPM} recording. Across the various criteria evaluated, 55.5-57.8\% of participants had nocturnal hypertension and 62.8-66.8\% had nondipping systolic {BP}. Among participants with clinic-measured systolic/diastolic {BP} of more than or equal to 140/90 {mmHg}, 22.9-26.5\% had white-coat hypertension. The prevalence of daytime, 24-h, sustained, and masked hypertension differed by up to 2\% for participants fulfilling each criterion. The association of {BP} phenotypes with {LVH} was similar for participants who fulfilled versus those who did not fulfill different criteria (each P{\textgreater}0.05).
{CONCLUSION}: Irrespective of the criteria used for defining a complete {ABPM} recording, the prevalence of {BP} phenotypes and their association with {LVH} were similar.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare performance of logistic regression ({LR}) with machine learning ({ML}) for clinical prediction modeling. Study design and setting: We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017), and extracted comparisons between {LR} and {ML} models for binary outcomes. Results: We included 71 out of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1250 (range 72-3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5-563) and 8 events per predictor (range 0.3-6,697). The most common {ML} methods were classification trees (30 studies), random forests (28), artificial neural networks (26), and support vector machines (24). Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between a {LR} and {ML} model ({AUC} range, 0.52-0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit({AUC}) between {LR} and {ML} was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit({AUC}) was 0.34 (0.20 to 0.47) higher for {ML}. Conclusions: We found no evidence of superior performance of {ML} over {LR} for clinical prediction modeling, but improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, to April 30, 2019.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Main Outcomes and Measures{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cardiovascular disease events, including coronary heart disease and stroke, experienced through December 31, 2014, and all-cause mortality experienced through December 31, 2016, were adjudicated. The associations of daytime {BP} and nighttime {BP}, separately, with {CVD} events and all-cause mortality were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}A total of 1034 participants (mean [{SD}] age, 58.9 [10.9] years; 337 [32.6\%] male; and 583 [56.4\%] taking antihypertensive medication) were included in the study. The mean daytime systolic {BP} ({SBP})/diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) was 129.4/77.6 mm Hg, and the mean nighttime {SBP}/{DBP} was 121.3/68.4 mm Hg. During follow-up (median [interquartile range], 12.5 [11.1-13.6] years for {CVD} and 14.8 [13.7-15.6] years for all-cause mortality), 113 {CVD} events and 194 deaths occurred. After multivariable adjustment, including in-clinic {SBP} and {DBP}, the hazard ratios ({HRs}) for {CVD} events for each {SD} higher level were 1.53 (95\% {CI}, 1.24-1.88) for daytime {SBP} (per 13.5 mm Hg), 1.48 (95\% {CI}, 1.22-1.80) for nighttime {SBP} (per 15.5 mm Hg), 1.25 (95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.51) for daytime {DBP} (per 9.3 mm Hg), and 1.30 (95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.59) for nighttime {DBP} (per 9.5 mm Hg). Nighttime {SBP} was associated with all-cause mortality ({HR} per 1-{SD} higher level, 1.24; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.45), but no association was present for daytime {SBP} ({HR}, 1.13; 95\% {CI}, 0.97-1.33) and daytime ({HR}, 0.95; 95\% {CI}, 0.81-1.10) and nighttime ({HR}, 1.06; 95\% {CI}, 0.90-1.24) {DBP}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Among African American individuals, higher daytime and nighttime {SBPs} were associated with an increased risk for {CVD} events and all-cause mortality independent of {BP} levels measured in the clinic. Measurement of daytime and nighttime {BP} using ambulatory monitoring during a 24-hour period may help identify African American individuals who have an increased cardiovascular disease risk.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Controlling blood pressure ({BP}) reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease.To determine whether {BP} control among {US} adults with hypertension changed from 1999-2000 through 2017-2018.Serial cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, weighted to be representative of {US} adults, between 1999-2000 and 2017-2018 (10 cycles), including 18 262 {US} adults aged 18 years or older with hypertension defined as systolic {BP} level of 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic {BP} level of 90 mm Hg or higher, or use of antihypertensive medication. The date of final data collection was 2018.Calendar year.Mean {BP} was computed using 3 measurements. The primary outcome of {BP} control was defined as systolic {BP} level lower than 140 mm Hg and diastolic {BP} level lower than 90 mm Hg.Among the 51 761 participants included in this analysis, the mean ({SD}) age was 48 (19) years and 25 939 (50.1\%) were women; 43.2\% were non-Hispanic White adults; 21.6\%, non-Hispanic Black adults; 5.3\%, non-Hispanic Asian adults; and 26.1\%, Hispanic adults. Among the 18 262 adults with hypertension, the age-adjusted estimated proportion with controlled {BP} increased from 31.8\% (95\% {CI}, 26.9\%-36.7\%) in 1999-2000 to 48.5\% (95\% {CI}, 45.5\%-51.5\%) in 2007-2008 (P \&lt; .001 for trend), remained stable and was 53.8\% (95\% {CI}, 48.7\%-59.0\%) in 2013-2014 (P = .14 for trend), and then declined to 43.7\% (95\% {CI}, 40.2\%-47.2\%) in 2017-2018 (P = .003 for trend). Compared with adults who were aged 18 years to 44 years, it was estimated that controlled {BP} was more likely among those aged 45 years to 64 years (49.7\% vs 36.7\%; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.18 [95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.37]) and less likely among those aged 75 years or older (37.3\% vs 36.7\%; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.81 [95\% {CI}, 0.65-0.97]). It was estimated that controlled {BP} was less likely among non-Hispanic Black adults vs non-Hispanic White adults (41.5\% vs 48.2\%, respectively; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.88; 95\% {CI}, 0.81-0.96). Controlled {BP} was more likely among those with private insurance (48.2\%), Medicare (53.4\%), or government health insurance other than Medicare or Medicaid (43.2\%) vs among those without health insurance (24.2\%) (multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.40 [95\% {CI}, 1.08-1.80], 1.47 [95\% {CI}, 1.15-1.89], and 1.36 [95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.76], respectively). Controlled {BP} was more likely among those with vs those without a usual health care facility (48.4\% vs 26.5\%, respectively; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.48 [95\% {CI}, 1.13-1.94]) and among those who had vs those who had not had a health care visit in the past year (49.1\% vs 8.0\%; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 5.23 [95\% {CI}, 2.88-9.49]).In a series of cross-sectional surveys weighted to be representative of the adult {US} population, the prevalence of controlled {BP} increased between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008, did not significantly change from 2007-2008 through 2013-2014, and then decreased after 2013-2014.},
